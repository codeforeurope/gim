<!-- The contents of this file will be loaded for each web application 
You should NOT turn this option on in production.
The antiResourceLocking option can stop JSPs from redeploying when they are 
edited (a reploy of the webapp is required instad and sometimes a clean out of the work directory).
There are small restrictions apparently on not being able to get certain kinds 
of resource paths to webapp resources for webapps that are being run from the special 
"temp" area but we have never run into them in practice.
